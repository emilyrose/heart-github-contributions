I Just Love the GitHub Contribution Graph

## Tuesday, March 18th 2014
It's midnight. The air is still. I shall draw on my contribution graph.

## Wednesday, March 19th 2014
Again I find myself writing markdown at midnight. Perhaps I shall continue this drawing...

## Monday, March 24th 2014
I believe I know what it is I wish to draw. I only hope I can follow through.

Three days later on the nose. I'm not sure what to make of this midnight thing.

## Monday, March 31st 2014
So far so good. Maybe I can do this after all. A labor of love is worth the effort.

## Friday, April 4th 2014
I'm still here. April is off to a rough start, but I will see this through.

## Tuesday, April 8th 2014
Almost half way there. I can't wait until this is completed.

## Saturday, April 12th 2014
My first and only entry on a weekend. This is an interesting pattern. 

## Monday, April 14th 2014
Maybe after I finish this drawing I can make something more complex?

## Friday, April 18th 2014
I forgot to put ordinals on most of my journal dates. Fixed that. 

## Monday, April 21st 2014
I think I know what I'm going to draw next! The next question is when?

This is the second to last entry. I can't believe I'm going to do make it.
